# Coilsnake-Labelled-Music-Files
This repository (requested by @livvy94) is the same as the output from Coilsnake, but properly labelled and categorized

The packs are listed in numerical order (0-F)

A .ebmused file is given to have the ROM names fit with the song tracks, for ease of searching

The instrument packs, and pack 01, have not been touched at the moment, but at some point I will
categorize them, but for now, here's a good resource! https://gist.github.com/livvy94/cb70ddd4c5309c0c52e662f985d6648b

If any errors are spotted, please let me know!

To Do List:
1. Rename the files inside Pack 01
2. rename the songs on songs.yml to their new names
3. Rename the Instrument Packs with where their packs are used for,
